# Well-then: Unofficial builds for the kool kidz.

Eli Bradley offers patches to the cutting edge software, "Well-then", in the form of patch-n builds. You can see the data on all of my patch-n builds in the table below. If you would like stability in your Well-then builds, check back here to know most issues that plague Well-then, and overall what builds you should be using currently. Note: 'Merged' means collumns have been merged into rows, and likewise, 'Compatible' means collumns _may_ be merged into rows using fast-forward merge style. Question marks symbolize uncertainty, as they do not belong in my project

Currently, larry0618/master and larry0618/gh-pages have conflicting changes regarding spacing conventions. They are both ancestored by my stable patch-3 branch. Thanks for visiting!
